Meaning:
Noflagasana symbolizes the concept of remaining still and centered, with no outward displayâ€”hence, the name "no-flag."

Technique:

Lie on your back in a supine position with legs straight and arms relaxed beside your body.
Inhaling, raise your right leg slowly to a comfortable angle, keeping your left leg grounded.
Maintain focus on your breath, breathing deeply and holding the position for five breaths.

Exhaling, bring your right leg down gently. Repeat with the left leg.
Release, relax the arms, and return to the starting position.
Benefits:
Noflagasana helps improve flexibility, strengthens the core, and fosters calmness.
It can aid in reducing stress and soothing anxiety.

Precaution:
Avoid this pose if you have a back injury, hip pain, or are recovering from abdominal surgery. Those with balance issues should perform with caution.
