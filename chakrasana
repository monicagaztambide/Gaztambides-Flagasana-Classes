'Cakra' means wheel. In the final position of this asana, body takes the shape of a wheel, hence the name.

Technique
Lie on the back, knees bent and heels touching the buttocks and feet 12 inches apart.
Raise the arms; bend the elbows; place the palms on the floor above the shoulders beside the head.
Inhale and slowly raise the trunk and arch the back.
Gently drop the head and straighten the arms and legs as much as possible.
Remain in this posture for as long as comfortable; then come back by slowly lowering the body so the head rests on the floor. Lower down also the rest of the body and relax.
A variation consists in raising the body on the toes instead on the feet.
